As we have become more increasingly dependent on technology, the role of cybersecurity and the cybersecurity professional in fields such as automotive design and security has become more prescient than ever before.  Cybersecurity professionals must be able to predict and prevent previously unprecedented threats and threat actors to both physical and digital automotive security   The ever increasing number of wired and wireless systems interconnected across the vehicle's bus form what could almost  be quantified as an intelligent technological organism.  Much like a biological organism, a problem such as a malware infection could damage or destroy that organism’s individual systems or system or spread like a cancer and cause multiple Infections in seemingly unrelated systems and create damage in many forms such as driver data exfiltration and opening new attack vectors such as possibly even gaining control of the vehicle.
The automotive industry is quickly transitioning to IoT connected vehicles as features such as autonomous driving, infotainment systems, and over-the-air updates become readily available, even on base models. While these technological advancements certainly do improve safety, convenience, fuel economy, and driver experience, they also expose vehicles and their drivers to new cybersecurity risks. Modern cars are now complex networks of embedded systems, sensors, and controllers that communicate with each other and external devices. This connectivity creates vulnerabilities and increases the likelihood of cyberattacks that can lead to data theft, unauthorized access, and manipulation of critical systems like braking or steering. One major challenge in automotive cybersecurity is the lack of real-time threat detection and mitigation mechanisms. Many vehicles still operate with outdated security protocols, making them susceptible to attacks targeting their communication channels and software vulnerabilities. This puts both drivers and passengers at risk, and poses a significant threat to public safety. Addressing these challenges requires robust, adaptive security solutions that can monitor and protect vehicles from malicious activities while maintaining optimal performance and safety.  Industry groups such as AUTOSAR with such participants as BMW, GM, Toyota, and Ford have sought to standardize software development on the 70 to 100 Electronic Control Units or ECU’s in an average automobile.
This paper will address the basic information technological architecture of the modern automobile’s digital infrastructure, the role of the Controller Area Network, and its critical vulnerabilities.  This paper will also address whether or not industry standards such as AUTOSAR, or ISO standards are sufficiently addressing the current and future needs of physical device and software cybersecurity and the possible negative effects of implementing certain effective but resource intensive cybersecurity measures.  Should there be a software solution like Norton 360 for car infrastructure and should the creation of such software be led by industry or do government stakeholders play a role?  Is it feasible to have hot swappable hardware devices placed in critical parts of the vehicle bus in order to maintain and upgrade vehicle security?  Should AI/ML be integrated into automotive security and in what potential ways?
